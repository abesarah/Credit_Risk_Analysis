![ ](/Resources/?raw=true=250x250)
### Purpose:

### Technologies Used: 
-	Python
    - Pandas
    - SciKit Learn
    
### [Deliverable 1](/credit_risk_resampling.ipynb)
- For all three algorithms, the following have been completed:
    - An accuracy score for the model is calculated
    - A confusion matrix has been generated
    - An imbalanced classification report has been generated 
    
### [Deliverable 2](/credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb)
- The BalancedRandomForestClassifier algorithm does the following:
    - An accuracy score for the model is calculated
    - A confusion matrix has been generated
    - An imbalanced classification report has been generated
    - The features are sorted in descending order by feature importance
    
- The EasyEnsembleClassifier algorithm does the following:
    - An accuracy score of the model is calculated
    - A confusion matrix has been generated
    - An imbalanced classification report has been generated
